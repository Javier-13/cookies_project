## Project Description

The scope of this project is to determine the attributes that make a cookie delicious. Based on historical data of 5K cookies regarding baked_temp, sugar_index among others, we develop a Machine Learning model to predict the quality of each cookie. Thanks to this approach, Cookie Flea will be able to develop the perfect cookie recipe for all of us to enjoy.

## Hypotheses / Questions

 What is the best combination of attribues to make the perfect cookie?
